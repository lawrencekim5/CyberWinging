Last Saturday (Oct 9, 2021) I competed in my first cybersecuriity competition, Hivestorm! It was a really fun experience and I was actually dissapointed that I didn't get to have more time to work on the competition boxes. For everyone out there that has yet to participate in a cybersecurity competition, look no further! I'll try to convince you to participate based on my positive experiences.

For those that are unfamiliar with Hivestorm, it is a competition that is focused on the defensive side of cybersecurity. Player must form teams of 2-4 members and have tasks that can be broken into three broad categories:  
1) Answering 3-5 forensic questions regarding logs or system information  
2) Completing specified administrative tasks  
3) Identifying and correcting as many misconfigurations and vulnerabilities as possible  

Completing these tasks will award your team with points relative to the difficulty of the task. I had some forensic questions award 6 points, while correcting simple misconfigurations such as implementing a secure password policy will award 2 points. The maximum number of points that can be earned is 100. With four machines, that makes the maximum point total to be 400.

When I competed, we were given virtual machines with the following operating systems: Ubuntu, Devian, Windows Server 2019, and Windows 10.
