## Welcome to Lawrence Kim's Blog

CyberWinging!

This is a site where I will post writeups about certifcations, CTFs, competitions, and other personal projects.

Etymology: I picked CyberWinging as the blog name because I am winging cybersecurity. I also like birds so I wanted to make a bird pun.


Take a look at [HackTheBox_Knife](/Writeups/HackTheBox_Knife.md) for more information.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. I did not know this and am keeping this default template up until I become more familiar with markdown.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lawrencekim555/lawrencekim.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
