## Welcome to Lawrence's Blog

This is a site where I will post writeups about certifcations, CTFs, competitions, and other personal projects.

I am very inexperienced when it comes to sharing my thoughts. The last time I shared a personal thought was when I told someone that I did not think ham was meat. The ridicule that I experienced still haunts me to this day. Ever since then I've become averse to human interaction. 

Of course that's a joke, but it is true that I haven't written a blog before. I hope to write entertaining as well as informative posts, so please read some of my posts and feel free to give feedback!

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. I did not know this and am keeping this default template up until I become more familiar with markdown.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lawrencekim555/lawrencekim.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
