# Welcome to Lawrence Kim's Blog

CyberWinging!

This is a site where I will post writeups about certifcations, CTFs, competitions, and other personal projects.  
I'm still in the process of learning web design so this site won't be too flashy for now.

Etymology: I picked CyberWinging as the blog name because I am winging cybersecurity. I also like birds so I wanted to make a bird pun.
